Description
-----------

The code for the classes and assignments of the Coursera Functional Programming in Scala course.

I completed this back in 2013, so I'll warn you that the course content will likely have changed.

I have recently (2016) upgraded the projects to use Scala 2.11 and SBT 0.13.

Prerequisites
--------------

1. IntelliJ IDEA with Scala/SBT plugins
2. Java 7 SDK

Setup
-----

Simply import each project into IntelliJ IDEA, selecting SBT import type and use the Java 7 project SDK.

For the assignments, import at the lowest directory level e.g. funsets, objsets, patmat etc.
